# Tour System

The `tour-system` is a QR-triggered, scan-to-earn tour experience protocol  
built on the RION architecture.

It connects directly to:

- **FIXEDcoin** (reward rail)
- **VaultPay** (scan + trigger)
- **E333** (royalty and donation streaming)
- **VaultFolder** (event session tracking)
- **Tour Agent Logic** (for real estate integration)

This is not just a scheduling tool.  
Itâ€™s a behavior-based Web3 engagement rail designed to drive:

- Passive income for agents  
- Protocol loyalty tracking  
- Homebuyer scan-to-participate rewards  
- FIXEDcoin usage in live market events

Protocol creator: RION
